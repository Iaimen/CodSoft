After that, computer choses random number between 0-2. if user or computer chooses 3 it will give prompt that it is Invalid number, type again. According to the rules of game, paper wraps rock, rock destroy scissors and scissor cut paper. On the basis of these rules, the result will be decided and displayed that who won the game.

In todo list, there will be four tasks: 1. add task in the list, 2. delete task from list, 3. Display list and 4. Exit. The program will ask user to enter choice,. If user type 1, it will ask the user to enter task in your list and task will be saved in the list. If the user types 2, it will ask that on which serial number your task is placed which you want to delete? The user type number and task on that place will be deleted from the list. If the user type 3,it will display the list with different tasks in it and if the user type 4, it will exit the terminal. Besides this i used the os module to save the file and open file and pickle module to make our list serializable and deserilalzable.
